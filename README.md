I am a writer / researcher / quantitative social scientist / recovering data scientist.

I draw cartoons, play guitar, and speak Spanish and Arabic. I like `tidyverse`, kettlebells, and Dominos pizza. I dislike `data.table`, bowling, and nachos. With my teammate Pearse (and Grigori, our 1999 Opel Corsa), I was a finisher of the 2017 Mongol Rally. We chronicled our journey on our [terrible Instagram](https://instagram.com/teamrasputin).

You can reach me at m [dot] a [dot] lerner [at] gmail [dot] com.


# Writing

## *The Economist*

I was an Editorial Fellow at *The Economist* from January 2021 to July 2021. I worked jointly for the US section and the data team. I wrote 25 pieces in 27 weeks, including 15 articles in the print magazine itself. My favorites are [this piece about homelessness in LA](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2021/05/15/what-to-do-about-skid-row) and [this data story about an uptick in car crashes in 2020](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2021/04/03/americans-are-driving-less-but-more-are-dying-in-accidents). I was also interviewed [on local TV in the Bay Area](https://www.kron4.com/news/real-estate/is-it-possible-to-build-houses-cheaply-in-bay-area/) about housing and [on The Economist's *The Intelligence* podcast](https://play.acast.com/s/d556eb54-6160-4c85-95f4-47d9f5216c49/4af669dc-4999-41bf-af67-9fd640a40858?seek=1039) about car crashes.

# Code

- While at [BrightHive](http://brighthive.io/), I wrote the grant application for a ~$1m award from the federal Department of Education. One of the deliverables for that grant was the the [ROI Toolkit](https://github.com/brighthive/roi-toolkit/), a Python library that I wrote for calculating return on investment metrics in education.

- For a project investigating the effectiveness of lobbying (see below), I worked up a [GitHub repo](https://github.com/mattlerner/lobbying) with R code for reading and parsing US [lobbying disclosure data](https://lda.senate.gov/system/public/)

- Way back in 2015, I created [PAC Explorer](https://pacexplorer.org/), a sort-of-retro-looking network visualization mapping funding flows between PACs and political candidates.

# Other stuff

- I wrote this [review of lobbying effectiveness](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/K638s9L2wCEW78DEF/informational-lobbying-theory-and-effectiveness) (see above) on the Effective Altruism Forum.

- I wrote my [MA thesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.04083) at Columbia on the effects of the Alaska Permanent Fund Dividend, a UBI-like cash transfer program begun in 1980. I used a synthetic control model and found no effects on high school completion rates (read the thesis to understand why I might have expected to see an effect in the first place).
